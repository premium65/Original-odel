THE PREMIUM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM EXPLAINED
===============================================================================

What it does:
Allows admins to assign premium hotel booking tasks to users. When users
complete these tasks, they earn commission fees added to their wallet.

How it works:
1. Admin selects a user from the user list
2. Admin enters hotel price to filter available hotels
3. Admin selects a hotel and sets commission percentage
4. Admin assigns a task number (1-30)
5. System creates premium task for the user
6. User completes the task
7. Commission is calculated and added to user's wallet

Commission Calculation:
Commission = (Percentage × Hotel Price) / 100

Example:
- Hotel Price: $1000
- Commission: 5%
- User Earns: $50
